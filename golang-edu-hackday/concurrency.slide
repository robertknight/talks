Go - Concurrency

18 Jun 2014

* Concurrency features

Go's _raison_d'Ãªtre_ is concurrency. Built on two main features:

- Goroutines
- Channels

* Goroutines

A _goroutine_ is a lightweight thread, there can be millions
at once.

Goroutines are created by putting _go_ in front of a function call.

	go func() {
		// ...
	}()

This creates a new goroutine. The Go runtime schedules goroutines
onto actual threads.

* Goroutines - Demo

.play code/goroutine.go

* Concurrency models - Event Loops

(Qt, Objective C, Android, Node.js, Twisted)

* Goroutines

Goroutines are not first class values

- No way to determine current Goroutine ID
- No way to wait on a particular Goroutine

* Goroutines

Widely used in standard library

.play code/timers.go

* Channels

Primary means of communication between goroutines.
Pipe which you can send or receive values of a particular type on.

Two types - Buffered and unbuffered

Sending _blocks_ if channel is full 
Receiving _blocks_ until a value is available to read

.play code/chan.go

* Channels - Buffered

.play code/chan_buffer.go
